# Cyberconnect Discount Middlewares

This repository contains a collection of
[Cyberconnect](https://cyberconnect.me/)
middlewares to apply a discount on an essence in several
different ways.
[CollectPaidMw.sol](https://github.com/cyberconnecthq/cybercontracts/blob/main/src/middlewares/essence/CollectPaidMw.sol)
is used as the base for writing these new middlewares.

## Usage:

### Option 1:
The [interfaces](abi) and [bytecodes](bin) of all the 
contracts are available. You can use them to deploy 
your own contract using [deploy.js](deploy.js).

### Option 2:
To compile and deploy the contracts you can clone the
original
[cybercontracts](https://github.com/cyberconnecthq/cybercontracts/tree/main)
repo, and copy your desired `.sol` file under
[essence](https://github.com/cyberconnecthq/cybercontracts/tree/main/src/middlewares/essence)
directory. Next, follow the
[deployment](https://github.com/cyberconnecthq/cybercontracts/tree/main#deployment)
guide to compile and deploy.
